class KNearestNeighbors:
    """
    A class representing the machine learning implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier from scratch.

    Attributes:
        n_neighbors
            An integer representing the number of neighbors a sample is compared with when predicting target class
            values.

        weights
            A string representing the weight function used when predicting target class values. The possible options are
            {'uniform', 'distance'}.

        _X
            A numpy array of shape (n_samples, n_features) representing the input data used when fitting the model and
            predicting target class values.

        _y
            A numpy array of shape (n_samples,) representing the true class values for each sample in the input data
            used when fitting the model and predicting target class values.

        _distance
            An attribute representing which distance metric is used to calculate distances between samples. This is set
            when creating the object to either the euclidean_distance or manhattan_distance functions defined in
            utils.py based on what argument is passed into the metric parameter of the class.

    Methods:
        fit(X, y)
            Fits the model to the provided data matrix X and targets y.

        predict(X)
            Predicts class target values for the given test data matrix X using the fitted classifier model.
